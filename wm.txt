I find myself typically using just two X applications: urxvt (a terminal
emulator) and Firefox.  There are other programs that I run occasionally
(gimp, gnucash, grip, mplayer, etc.), but still few enough total that I
wouldn't mind if I had to spend a few minutes configuring a window manager
to display each to my preferences.

I have different window-size requirements for each of the programs.  When
I'm writing code in a terminal emulator, I'd like it to be exactly eighty
columns wide and as tall as will fit on the screen; when running vimdiff to
view code, I'd like the terminal window to be 165 columns; when viewing a
log file with long lines, I'd like the window to be as wide as possible.  I
should be able to quickly switch between these different window
configurations depending on what I'm trying to do at the moment.  I
envision a configuration format similar to the following:

  window_config {
    criteria {
      class_name /.*rxvt/
    }
    config {
      name default
      width 80u  # 'u' means app-specified units; default is pixels
      height *
    }
    config {
      name maximized
      width *
      height *
    }
  }

  # configs are additive unless specified otherwise
  window_config {
    criteria {
      class_name /.*rxvt/
      title_name vimdiff  # substring match by default
    }
    config {
      name vimdiff
      width 165h
      height *
    }
  }

  # define a fallback config if no others match
  window_config {
    single_match true
    config {
      name application-requested
      width app
      height app
    }
    config {
      name maximized
      width *
      height *
    }
  }

While writing code in a terminal window, I may need to view documentation
and examples from a web page.  At the same time, I could be reading email
in a Firefox window and composing a message in another window.  I should be
able to be able to group the windows into two distinct virtual desktops so
I can quickly switch between them.  If I need to refer to the code while
composing the message, I should be able to easily add the terminal window
to the group of email windows (to be more explicit, windows may live in
multiple virtual desktops).

The windows that I want to display may not all fit onscreen at my desired
sizes without overlapping.  In this case, I should be able to define which
window appears on top, and furthermore, possibly which parts of the other
windows are visible in the remaining space.  I should even be able to
instruct the window manager to resize the other windows rather than only
displaying part of their contents.  If Xgl is available, it is perhaps
reasonable to tell the window manager to scale down the other windows.

Within a desktop, windows are grouped together by their attachment to
window anchors.  The anchor itself is visualized as the the set of tabbed
titlebars for the group of windows.  Only a single window attached to each
anchor can be visible.  Anchors are implemented similarly to Ion's tabbed
frames -- keyboard commands can be used to select which window is displayed
and to tag and move windows between anchors.  Anchors can be moved around
the screen.  It should maybe be possible to control whether the anchor
appears at the top or bottom of its set of windows.

Anchor configuration is saved to disk and reloaded when the window manager
is restarted.  It should be possible to quickly define to which anchor new
windows should be attached, and to toggle whether they should initially be
focused or instead created as an inactive tab.


commands:
---------
move focus left/right/up/down
switch current window to next/prev configs
execute arbitrary command
focus nth window in current position
focus next/prev window in current position
switch screen between horizontal and vertical layout
switch screen between overlapping and shared mode
tag window
attach tagged windows to current position
attach tagged windows to current window group
switch to next/prev window group
detach tagged windows (or current window if none are tagged?) from current window group

also, command-line program that can do all of this, reconfig, etc.?
probably just have a console like ion?
