- kill window-in-multiple-anchors concept, replace with sticky anchors
  (after thinking about this some more to make sure that there are no
  useful cases)
- save global anchor/window stacking order
- Menu: write class and add to DrawingEngine
- parse DrawingEngine styles from config
- make config-parsing return ConfigErrors
- handle "include" directive
- include filename in ConfigErrors
- maybe use Pango for drawing graphics
- add select loop to add a timer
- InfoWindow: write class and add to DrawingEngine
- double-check fork() in exec
- redraw anchor titlebar when window name changes
- clip window name text in anchor
- subtract titlebar height from maximized window height
- a million other things
